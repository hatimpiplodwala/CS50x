                I don't play games as much as I used to but I get in a good session once in a while. I like almost all times of games like arcade,
                RPG, open-world, fighting, and shooters. I play a lot of PUBG coz personally I think it's the best battle royale game but my
                favourite game is Minecraft coz of the simplicity and creative liberty the game offers. There's so many things that you can do and
                the only limit is your imagination.

                I'm no pro but I like to sketch random things here and there. I also like making portraits of people. I think being able to draw
                a person's proportions and get a similarity of the person on paper is really cool. I've kinda dialed down a bit on it recently but
                I do wanna get back and do more of it but whenever I'm free I pick up a pencil and start making small features like eyes, face
                shapes, sketch out proportions just to not go out of practice.

                This is something I've picked up due to my sister. She's a huge book nerd and she used to give me books to read but her and my tastes
                don't match at all so I didn't read for a long time but she found books of genres that I found interesting such as sci-fi, philosophy, history,
                and mystery, and ever since I'm hooked to it. Currently I'm reading a book called Thirteen by Tom Hoyle. I'm having a lot of fun reading
                it. It's kind of a cult murder mystery, really engaging. My favourite author tho is Isaac Asimov (The best sci-fi author in my opinion).

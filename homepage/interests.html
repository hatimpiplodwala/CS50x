                Tennis is one of my favourite sports to watch. I watch all the major tournaments like the US Open, the French
                Open and Wimbledon with my family. Recently, I watched the 2022 Wimbledon tournament and it had some of the best
                tennis matches of all time. Also, you get to see a lot of celebrities in the audience and in Wimbledon, even the
                royal family sometimes is in the audience. My favourite player right now is Nick Kyrgios.

                UFC is a professional MMA organization where fighters from all over the world from different martial arts
                backgrounds compete in various weight divisions to become the ultimate fighter in that class.
                And unlike WWE it's all real. My favourite weight division is lightweight coz it has a history of having some of the most
                dominating fighters (i.e., Khabib). My favourite fighter in the division right now is Charles Oliviera.

                My favourite channel on YouTube. They breakdown VFX shots and offer some of their insights on how
                these effects are done in movies and they have industry specialists come on as guests to explain how they did shots in movie
                to get a proper understanding of how these things are done. They also have a lot of videos where they teach how to do special effects
                and how someone with no experience can get into this field. I have a lot of fun watching these videos and they are very informative
                as well. My favourite crew member is Wren.
